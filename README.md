### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Sophie, and I have recently completed a course bootcamp in JavaScript basics. I have a particular interest in JavaScript and Python.

#### About me
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on hosting a final version of a group project: Stackdew Valley.   

This is a small game hosted in the web browser, based on our experience of the Northcoders bootcamp. This was mainly built using JavaScript and Phaser, with Tiled for visuals and Firebase for the database and hosting.
  
You can find the hosted link here soon...
   
ðŸŒ±  Iâ€™m currently learning basic TypeScript.    

ðŸ’¡  The link to my other project, nc-news, will be here soon.
