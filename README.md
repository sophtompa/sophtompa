## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Sophie, and I have recently completed a course bootcamp in JavaScript basics. I have a particular interest in coding in JavaScript and Python.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on hosting a final version of a group project: Stackdew Valley.   

This is a project where I built a small web browser game with a team of five other people, which we based on our experience in Northcoders and the idea of making a career change into tech. The game involves farming elements, where you grow a coding student (a 'devling'), and battle scenes, where the students fight for a place in the job market. This was made mainly using JavaScript and Phaser.

You can find the hosted link here soon...
   
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning basic TypeScript.    
ðŸ’¡ The link to my other project, nc-news, will be here soon.
